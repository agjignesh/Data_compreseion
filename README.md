This is our project for the GE103 course. In this video, we have explained different approaches to DATA COMPRESSION and presented our codes with an explanation.  The three methods we used for data compression are Huffman coding, Shannon-fano algorithm and a naive approach. We have proved that the most optimal method for data compression is the Huffman algorithm and for the same, we have tested for three data files.
